About the app
=============
This is an iOS app to be used by the mentors and interns during internship. It lets the mentor and intern share a progress 
report based on the daily progress added by the intern. The intern can manage the mentors with whom he wants to share his progress. The mentor can view the progress reports of all interns working under him. 
This app uses Apigee's App Services, which is a free hosted version of the open source BaaS project called Usergrid.
